A t ree is a recursive data structure.

Binary Tree: A tree with atmost 2 child nodes. (0,1 or 2 childnodes).

Depth of node: Distance of a node from root node. (count edges).

Levels in a tree start from 0.

The height of binary tree is the number of levels in the tree.

The width of node is the number of nodes on the level containing the most nodes.

Size of binary tree is number of nodes in the tree.

Full Binary tree or Strictly binary Tree-SBT: A node can have no children or 2 children. 1 child is not allowed.

Perfect binary tree: A binary tree in which all leaf nodes are on same level. It is a SBT with each node having only 2 children. It has all slots filled.

Almost complete binary tree ACBT: It is a type of binary tree where all levels are filled except for the last level, which is only partially filled from left to right. 
In an ACBT, nodes are inserted level by level and from left to right. The next level can only be reached if the previous level is full.
The left and right subtrees of ACBT differ in height by 0 or 1

Every PBT is a ACBT but not every ACBT is a PBT

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

DFS- Depth for search has 3 traversal methods: 
	1. inordertraversal
	2. preordertraversal
	3. postordertraversal


DFS does not explicitly include null for missing nodes. It only records the values of nodes in the specific traversal order.
