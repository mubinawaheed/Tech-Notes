const obj = {
  prop: 42,
};

Object.freeze(obj);

obj.prop = 33;
// Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop);
// Expected output: 42

in javascript => Object.freeze makes an object immutable by preventing new properties from being added, existing properties from being removed, and existing properties from being changed.
