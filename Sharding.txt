Breaking large tables into partitions (each of which contains the subset of the whole table) and storing each partition on separate servers is called sharding.

Sharding Techniques:
geo, range-based, hash, and directory

Manual vs Automatic sharding:


Hot spots



Each shard is a live production database server.



Sharding in sql and nosql


Sharding improves query performance and reduces processing time.
Avoids single point of failure.
sharding is like horizontal scaling, you can also add shard on runtime.
All shards run on different nodes/servers but share the same schema.

Software developers will use a shard key to decide how to partition a dataset.

sharding mostly work on shared-nothing type of architecture because nodes/physical shards are independent of each other.
