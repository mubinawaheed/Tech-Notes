Quick sort: Good sorting algorithm with worst case time complexity o(n2) and best case : O(nlogn).
it is an inplace or in-situ algorithm because it returns the sorted array in the same array without using additional data structures. Though it uses an stack to hold partitioned sub sequences.

The number of elements/subsequences in the stack is equal to the number of edges in the longest branch of the tree.

Space complexity of best case of quickSort is O(logn) and worst case is o(n)
