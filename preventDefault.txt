event.preventDefault() is a method in JavaScript that is used to prevent the default behavior of an event from occurring. Itâ€™s particularly useful in situations where you want to stop the browser's default action associated with an event, allowing you to implement custom behavior instead.

example:To prevent a form from submitting and reloading the page when the submit button is clicked.
