Decorators: Decorators are special kinds of declarations that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. They provide a way to add metadata to these elements and can modify their behavior.

The defineMetadata method is used to attach metadata to an object or a property of an object. Let's break down the four arguments it takes:
metadataKey: A key to identify the metadata. Itâ€™s usually a string or a symbol that uniquely identifies the metadata being set.
metadataValue: The value of the metadata. This can be any type of value you want to store, such as a string, number, object, etc.
target: The target object to which the metadata is being attached. This could be a class, a prototype, or an instance of a class.
propertyKey: (Optional) The key of the property of the target object to which the metadata is being attached. This is typically a string or a symbol representing the name of the property.
